Place the hero phone image here with the exact filename `iphone-15-pro.png`.

This file will be served at `/assets/hero/iphone-15-pro.png` and the HomePage will prefer it for the iPhone hero slide.

Recommended steps:
1. Save the attached PNG to: `frontend/public/assets/hero/iphone-15-pro.png`
2. Restart the dev server if it's already running, or refresh the browser.

If the image is missing, the hero will fall back to the featured product image or a placeholder.
